	 <h2>When is the best month to see the northern lights?</h2>
	 <p>The best time to see the Northern Lights in Alaska, according 
	    to AI Overview is between mid-August and mid-April, with the 
		darkest months of December, January, and February often cited 
		as prime viewing times. While the aurora occurs year-around, 
		longer, darker nights in the winter months provide better 
		viewing opportunities.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Where is the best place in Alaska to the northern lights?</h2>
	  <p>Most people will agreen that Fairbanks is the best place to see 
	     the northern lights in Alaska and my recommendations are to fly

		 Arean and Chena Hot Springs are some other great places to see 
		 the aurora borealis near Fairbank.
